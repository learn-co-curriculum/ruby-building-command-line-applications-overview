# Ruby: Building Command Line Applications Course Overview

Welcome! We're glad you're here learning with us. Whether you're a complete beginner or have dabbled in Ruby, this course gives a comprehensive and solid foundation for you to be well on your way to becoming a web developer. By the end of this course, you'll build several applications including a Tic Tac Toe game with AI, your very own Ruby Gem, and a command line music player application. 


This course covers eight high-level topics:

**1 Variables and Methods**
Variables and methods are the bread and butter of programming. They help us refer to describe data flexibly and to encapsulate repeated process in easy-to-use ways.

**2 Logic and Conditionals**
When we want our programs to respond in specific ways to specific inputs, we need to use a bit of logic. You’ll master the fundamentals of controlling the flow of your programs, making sure that you get the data you need.

**3 Iteration**
Data doesn’t come in a trickle — it comes in a stream. By mastering iteration, you’ll be able to handle large amounts of information effortlessly.

**4 Data Structures**
It helps to be able to describe our data in different ways. By learning the ins of outs of how different data types fit together, you’ll be able to grapple with information of all shapes and sizes.

**5 Regex**
Regular expressions (“regex” for short) are powerful miniature state machines — bits of code that can be used to work with text in clever ways.

**6 Object-Oriented Programming**
As programmers, we always look for abstractions to make our programs easier to think about. Object-oriented programming lets us describe our programs in terms of how their pieces interact, giving us real-world metaphors for the processes that are happening on our computers.

**7 Metaprogramming**
When you think about it, our programs are actually data themselves. Metaprogramming makes use of this abstraction to allow us to write powerful and flexible methods that can influence how our code works as it’s working. (Don’t worry if that makes your head spin a little.)

**8 Scraping**
The web is overflowing with data — if only we had a way to get it. You’ll learn how to pull data from just about anywhere on the web, and how to use that data to glean useful insights for your everyday work.

Take time reading through the lessons. Some of the labs you encounter will be straightforward while others will be more challenging. Learning to program is hard and we don't dumb it down for you. Sometimes you might find yourself googling for the best way to do something, and we've designed this curriculum so that you do that. Learning how to learn and find answers is a big part of the coding journey. But any time you're stuck, also know that you can use the Ask a Question feature in Learn and we'll be here to help you out!

Happy coding!
